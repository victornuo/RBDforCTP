RBDforCTP
=========

Route Back Delivery mechanism for Collection Tree based application

This implementation has been made to work together with CTP protocol included in TinyOS 2.1

The aim of this component is to add a mechnims to provide bidirectional communicaitons between the node and the root
of the collection tree.

Main advantage of this component is that the reverse routes are built without adding coontrol messages to the original CTP.
